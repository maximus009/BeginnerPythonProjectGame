Beginner Python Project Game
============================

This is our beginner python project to make a game using Pygame.

So far we have a background and sprite displaying.

How to Contribute
=================
We are using Python 3.x to develop this game.

You can get it here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.4/

or ```sudo apt-get install python3```

You will also need to install PyGame for 3.2: http://pygame.org/download.shtml

Alternatively you can compile it from source: http://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu?parent=index

For now all sprites/images will need to be .bmp files to avoid
errors due to lack of libraries or whatnot. I suggest just opening
up any image you'd like to use in GIMP, adding an Alpha Channel
and removing any white space, then exporting as a .bmp file.
